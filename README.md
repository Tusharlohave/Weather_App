# Weather_App

This repository contains the source code for a simple yet functional weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience with API integration, specifically for fetching and displaying real-time weather data.   

Key Features:

Real-time Weather Data:
The application utilizes a weather API OpenWeatherMap to fetch current weather conditions for a specified location.
Users can typically search for a city or allow the application to use their geolocation.

Dynamic Display:
Weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions, is dynamically displayed on the user interface.
Visual elements, such as weather icons, are used to enhance the user experience.

API Integration:
The project demonstrates how to make asynchronous API requests using JavaScript's fetch API or similar methods.
It covers handling API responses, parsing JSON data, and updating the DOM accordingly.

Front-End Development:
HTML is used for structuring the application's content.   
CSS is used for styling and layout, ensuring a responsive design.   
JavaScript is used for handling user interactions, API calls, and data manipulation.
